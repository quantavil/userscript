## 🚀 Features

### 🎨 Premium Aesthetics
- **Modern Dark Theme**: A carefully curated color palette featuring deep blacks (`#09090b`), subtle borders, and vibrant accents.
- **Micro-interactions**: Smooth transitions and hover effects on all interactive elements.
- **Glassmorphism-inspired**: Navigation and headers use modern styling for a premium feel.
- **No FOUC**: Critical CSS is injected immediately to prevent the dreaded "Flash of Unstyled Content."

### ⚙️ Enhanced Control Bar
When browsing scripts, a custom control bar appears at the top of the list:
- **Smart Sorting**: Easily switch between Daily Installs, Total Installs, Ratings, and Update dates.
- **Live Filtering**: 
  - **Daily Installs Slider**: Filter out low-traction scripts in real-time.
  - **Total Installs Slider**: Focus on well-vetted scripts.
- **Dynamic Stats**: Instantly see how many scripts match your current filters.

### ⌨️ Power-User Shortcuts

- <kbd>/</kbd> : Focus the search bar.
- <kbd>i</kbd> : Instantly trigger the "Install" link on a script page.
- <kbd>g</kbd> : Smoothly scroll back to the top of the page.

### 📱 Responsive & Focused
- **Mobile Friendly**: Designed to work gracefully on smaller screens.
